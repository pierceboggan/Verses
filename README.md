# Verses
Verses is an iOS application developed by Pierce Boggan using [Xamarin.iOS](http://www.xamarin.com). Verses allows you to store both prayers and verses, though its main functionality lies in helping users to memorize Scripture. If you are looking for a good example of a real-world application built with Xamarin, this is a great opportunity. All of the code (and images) in this repository is [MIT licensed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), basically meaning you can [do what you want](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) as long as you cite the original copyright.
